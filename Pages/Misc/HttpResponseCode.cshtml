	<h3>Common HTTP Response Codes</h3>
	<pre>
	Here are some of the most essential HTTP response status codes:

	200 OK: This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests. 
	It indicates that the request has been successfully processed, and the server is returning the requested resource.

	201 Created: This status code is typically used after a successful POST request to indicate that a new resource has 
	been successfully created on the server.

	204 No Content: It indicates that the request was successful, but there is no additional information to send back in the response. 
	It is often used in conjunction with PUT or DELETE requests.

	301 Moved Permanently: This status code indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URL. 
	The client should update its links to the new URL.

	302 Found (or 307 Temporary Redirect): Indicates a temporary redirection. 
	The client should use the original request URL for future requests.

	400 Bad Request: This indicates that the server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax or other client-side errors.

	401 Unauthorized: The client's request lacks proper authentication credentials, or the provided credentials are invalid.

	403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to fulfill it. 
	This typically indicates that the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.

	404 Not Found: This is perhaps the most recognized HTTP status code. 
	It indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server.

	500 Internal Server Error: This is a generic server error message. 
	It suggests that something went wrong on the server's end while processing the request.

	503 Service Unavailable: This status code indicates that the server is temporarily unable to handle the request 
	due to maintenance or overloading. It's often used when a server is undergoing maintenance.
