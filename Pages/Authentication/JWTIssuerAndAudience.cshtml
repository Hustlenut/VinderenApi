	<h3>JWT - Issuer and Audience</h3>
	<pre>
	Issuer (iss): The issuer is the entity that issues (creates and signs) the JWT. It typically represents the identity of 
	the server or service that's generating the token. It is often a URL or identifier associated with the authentication server. 
	The issuer is a way to verify the authenticity of the token.

	Audience (aud): The audience represents the recipient of the JWT. It specifies who the token is intended for. 
	The audience can be the client application that is expected to consume the token. By specifying the audience, 
	you ensure that the token is only accepted by the intended audience.

	So, in JWT validation:

	Issuer Validation: You check that the "iss" claim in the token matches the expected issuer. 
	This ensures that the token was issued by a trusted authority.

	Audience Validation: You check that the "aud" claim in the token matches the expected audience. 
	This ensures that the token is intended for your application and not for some other recipient.

	Here's a simplified example:

	Suppose you have a server (your API) that issues JWTs for client applications. In this case:

	The "iss" claim in the JWT would be the identity of your server (e.g., the URL of your authentication server).
	The "aud" claim would be the identifier of the client application that the token is intended for.
	By validating these claims, you can ensure that the token was issued by your server and is intended for a specific 
	client application. This helps prevent misuse of tokens by unauthorized parties.

	In practice, you configure your authentication system to validate these claims to ensure the security and integrity 
	of your JWT-based authentication.
